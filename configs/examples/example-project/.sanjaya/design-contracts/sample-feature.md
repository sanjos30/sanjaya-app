# Feature: Sample Demo Feature

## Summary
This is a placeholder feature used to validate the Sanjaya platform end-to-end.

## Problem
Demonstrate how Sanjaya loads a project config and design contract.

## User Story
“As a developer, I want to run the feature workflow so that I can test the orchestrator.”

## Scope
- No real code generation
- Only structural validation

## Expected Output
- Orchestrator reads this file
- Workflow returns a successful stub response

## Acceptance Criteria
- workflow_type = feature_from_contract
- contract exists
- autopilot.yaml loads correctly
